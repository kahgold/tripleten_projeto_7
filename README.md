# Project: Internship at Y.Afisha

*After managing to show brilliant performance during the Tripleten course. You were offered the opportunity to undergo an intership program in the **Y.Afisha's Analytics Departement**. On your first day, the **marketing department** give you a task to help them **optimize the marketing cost budget**.*

*In front of you are available data from January 2017 to December 2018 which consist of 3 files containing:*
- **Servers logs**/record of Y.Afisha site visit;
- **Order** data;
- Marketing **cost statistics**.

*By completing this task, they expect you to learn:*
- Y.Afisha user behaviour;
- Cohort analysis;
- Revenue generated;
- When all marketing costs pay off.

**Project Instructions**
1. ***Download data and prepare it for analysis***
    - Store visit, order, and expense data in variables.
    - Optimize the data you have for analysis purposes.
    - Make sure each of its columns is presented in the correct data type.
    - File path:
        - /datasets/visits_log_us.csv
        - /datasets/orders_log_us.csv
        - /datasets/costs_us.csv

2. ***Compile reports and calculate metrics:***
    
    - **Product**
        - How many people **use** the product **every day**, **week**, and **month**?
        - What is the number of **sessions per day**? (One user may have more than one session).
        - What is the **duration** for **each session**?
        - How often do **users return** to using the product?

    - **Sales**
        - **When** do people **start** making purchases?
            - **Additional Note**: In **KPI analysis**, we are usually interested in knowing the time that **elapses from** the time the **registration** is made until the **conversion** occurs or when an authorized user switches to a customer. For example, if the first registration and purchase occurred on the same day, that user could be included in the h0 Conversion category. If the first purchase occurs the next day, the category will also be h1 Conversions. You are welcome to use any approach that allows you to compare conversions from different cohorts, so you can determine which cohort or marketing channel is most effective.
        - How many **orders** do they make **over a period of time**?
        - What is the **average purchase size**?
        - How much money do they contribute? (**LTV**)

    - **Marketing**
        - How much **money is spent**? Overall/per source/over time
        - How much does **customer acquisition cost** (CAC) from each source?
        - How profitable is the investment? (**ROI**)

     *Create a **graph** that shows **how these metrics differ** for **different devices** and **ad sources**, as well as how they have **changed over time**.*

3. ***Writing down the conclusion:*** *tell marketing specialists how much money to invest and **where it should be invested**.*
   - What **sources/platforms** would you **recommend**?
   - Give reasons to support your choice:
       - What **metrics** do you focus on?
       - **Why**?
       - What **conclusions** do you make after finding the values of those metrics?
